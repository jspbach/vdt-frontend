# Frontend

Hey! Here's the repository for the frontend server, built using Next.JS (and a healthy dose of prebuilt components from the [almighty God themselves](https://github.com/shadcn) - their identities shall never be revealed).

Automation et al. is in the backend repository, though you do need to pull this one to your local environment to build the Docker image for it. To maintain compatibility with the backend, please name the image `frontend`. Or just use the Ansible playbook I wrote for this.
